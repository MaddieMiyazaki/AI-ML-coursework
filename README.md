## Two-Layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Implementation

I completed this project as part of coursework for the AI & ML module taught in semester 1. 

I developed a two-layer CNN with 5 input nodes, 4 hidden nodes and 1 output node with fixed weights and ReLU activation at each layer. 
The function convnet.py implements forward propagation to perform automatic differentiation with respect to one of the weights: ` 


### Skills demonstrated
- a mathematical understanding of CNNs and automatic differentiation
- a modular implementation of an algorithm as a single Python function
- use of object oriented programming
